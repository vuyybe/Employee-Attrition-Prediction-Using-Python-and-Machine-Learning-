# **Objective**

To develop a logistic regression model that accurately predicts employee attrition based on key factors. This model will enable organizations to proactively identify and address the root causes of attrition, 
leading to improved employee retention and reduced turnover costs.

# **Key Factors**
Based on extensive research and industry best practices, the following factors are commonly identified as significant contributors to employee attrition:

1. Demographic factors: Age, Gender, Marital status
2. Job satisfaction factors: Job involvement, Job satisfaction, Work-life balance, Promotion opportunities
3. Organizational factors: Company size, Industry, Tenure
4. Compensation and benefits: Training and development opportunities
5. Performance factors: Employee performance ratings
   
# **Logistic Regression Model**
A logistic regression model will be employed to analyze the relationship between these factors and the likelihood of employee attrition. 
The model will output a probability score between 0 and 1, indicating the predicted probability of an employee leaving the organization.

# **Model Development Process**

1. Data Collection: Gather relevant employee data, including demographic information, job satisfaction surveys, performance metrics, and attrition status.
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data by handling missing values, outliers, and converting categorical variables into numerical representations.
3. Feature Selection: Identify the most significant factors that contribute to employee attrition using techniques like correlation analysis or feature importance.
4. Model Building: Construct the logistic regression model using the selected features and train it on the historical data.
5. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. Model Deployment: Deploy the trained model into a production environment to make predictions for new employees.

# **Expected Outcomes**

- Accurate prediction of employee attrition: The model will provide reliable predictions of which employees are likely to leave the organization.
- Identification of key drivers of attrition: The model will help identify the most critical factors contributing to employee turnover.
- Targeted retention strategies: Organizations can use the model's insights to develop targeted retention strategies and address the root causes of attrition.
- By developing and implementing this logistic regression model, organizations can proactively manage employee turnover, improve retention rates, and enhance overall employee satisfaction.
